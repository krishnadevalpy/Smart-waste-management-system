Design project on smart waste management system using Nodemcu 12-E

# Introduction

Today big cities around the world are facing a common problem, proper waste management. The ordinary waste management systems involve a large number of employees being appointed to attend a certain number of dumpsters. This is done every day periodically. This leads to a very inefficient and unclean system in which some dumpsters will be overflowing some dumpsters might not be even half full. This is caused by variation in population density in the city or some other random factor which makes it impossible to determine which part needs immediate attention. Additionally, the mixing up of dry and wet wastes further escalates the trouble in waste management. Here a waste management system is introduced in which each dumpster is embedded with a monitoring system which will detect when the dumpster is full. It is also possible to separate wet and dry waste into two separate containers. This system provides an effective solution to the problem.
